                         Documentation: Task Scheduler Application
Introduction

The Task Scheduler is a simple, menu-driven Java application designed to help users manage tasks efficiently. Using a priority-based approach, it ensures that tasks with earlier deadlines are prioritized for completion. The application is built on the PriorityQueue data structure, which inherently supports such prioritization.

What the Task Scheduler Can Do?

The Task Scheduler is a program designed to manage tasks efficiently. Users can add tasks with descriptions and deadlines, and the system prioritizes tasks with shorter deadlines. The application allows users to view all tasks in the queue, providing a clear overview of the current workload. The "Process Tasks" function removes and processes the highest priority task, ensuring that the most urgent tasks are addressed first. Finally, the "Exit Safely" function ensures a clean shutdown, closing all necessary resources.

Why I Made This Application?

The Task Scheduler was created to address the common challenge of effectively managing time and tasks in our busy world. By prioritizing tasks based on deadlines, it helps users avoid missing critical deadlines. This project, which I developed, served as a learning opportunity to explore key programming concepts like data structures, object-oriented programming principles, and real-world problem-solving. Additionally, it provides a valuable tool for individuals and teams who want to implement task prioritization in their own projects or for personal productivity.

How It Contributes to Me and the Community?

Building the Task Scheduler helped me improve my Java skills and problem-solving. It's a simple tool that prioritizes tasks based on deadlines, making it useful for productivity. The code can also be used as an educational resource. This project has the potential to be expanded with more features.
